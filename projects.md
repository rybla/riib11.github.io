# Metagnosis (Podcast)

I co-host the [Metagnosis](https://metagnosis.simplecast.com/) podcast (which is currently on hiatus) with my friend [Yuta Kato](https://yutakato.substack.com). We cover a large range of topics, most often related to:
- [philosophy](https://metagnosis.simplecast.com/episodes/truth-and-lie-friedrich-nietzsche),
- [culture](https://metagnosis.simplecast.com/episodes/comedic-skill),
- [film](https://metagnosis.simplecast.com/episodes/persona-muholland-drive-and-clouds-of-sils-maria-female-doubles-and-violence),
- [literature](https://metagnosis.simplecast.com/episodes/discuss-judgement),
- [politics](https://metagnosis.simplecast.com/episodes/talking-about-talking-about-politics),
- [science](https://metagnosis.simplecast.com/episodes/personality-and-the-big-5),
