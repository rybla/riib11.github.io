# Definition

The [ERC-721 non-fungible token standard][erc-721] is an [Ethereum][ethereum]
(smart-)contract standard that specifies what a non-fungible token (NFT)
contract is. In short and simply, an NFT contract simply requires that the
tokens minted by the contract are non-fungible by requiring each token to have a
unique token identifier. The NFT contract can be publicall queried to learn
information such as who owns each NFT.

It's basically\* as simple as that!

NFT-like contracts were possible even before [ERC-721][erc-721] was defined.
However, the standard is useful so that all contracts that aim to offer NFT
functionalities provide the same interface and terminology to developers.

# Use Cases so Far

At the time of writing this article, the topic of NFTs has spun up into a sort
of craze. This is not only among crytocurrency enthusiasts --- the term "NFT"
has also broken into the mainstream. Just a week ago my mother sent me an
article about how a
[nyan cat NFT sold for $605k](https://www.engadget.com/nyan-cat-auction-nft-114830079.html).
I see that the NYT is beginning to
[auction its columns off as NFTs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/24/technology/nft-column-blockchain.html?name=styln-nfts&region=TOP_BANNER&block=storyline_menu_recirc&action=click&pgtype=Article&impression_id=&variant=show).
And over the last few weeks there have been a significant number of
high-grossing NFT sales:

- ["everydays" image sold for $69M](https://fortune.com/2021/03/22/he-sold-a-piece-nft-art-for-69-million-now-this-digital-artist-declares-the-market-is-a-giant-bubble/)
- TODO: more examples

Beyond just these high-bidding items, there are numerous current experiments
(many of which began before this recent trend) that use NFTs in many different
ways. To name a few:

- [Cryptocitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co). collectible, breedable kitties
- [Cryptovoxels](https://www.cryptovoxels.com). voxel art
- [Gods Unchained TCG](https://godsunchained.com/). collectible card game
- [Ethereum Name Service](https://app.ens.domains/name/ethereum.eth). a
  decentralized, Ethereum-powered alternative to DNS -- TODO: more examples

See [the Ethereum foundations page on NFTs](https://ethereum.org/en/nft/) for
more examples and other details.

I see the current significant use cases for NFTs as falling into two categories:

- digital art
- digital collectibles
- digital history
- random...

## Digital Art

The classic problem (not exclusively) for digital artists is capturing the value
of content that, typically, is freely accessible. Aside from the value of owning
the copyright to the IP, there is not _thing_ of value that the art consists of
that the creator can sell. The best option for many artists is to sell the
copyright (permantently or temporarily) and merchandise and to profit off of the
brand name that their

<!-- comparison to movie production: Some digital art forms, such as production movies, have settled into an economic role where they typically do not sell directly to the consumer. A movie producer sells the rights to play a movie to movie theater companies and streaming services, and _then_ the consumer buys access to enter a theater or stream the video.  -->
