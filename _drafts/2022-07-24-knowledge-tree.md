I still share the insatiable curiousity of myself between the ages 14-21. But
I've since developed a growing appreciation for just how deep, broad, and truly
vast the _knowledge tree_ is.

In coversations with friends a sentiment that has
repeatedly arisen: "there are too many books, too many facts, too many people...
I'll never be able to learn everything!" In addition, they usually add the
judgement" "And, that makes me very sad." I can't deny the claim, but I've never
sympathized much with the subsequent judgement.

Another repeating sentiment that I've noticed: "Anything can be interesting, if
you look into it closely enough." This one I mostly agree with as well, but I
see it more as annoying problem as opposed to an insightful observation. I
intermittently get sucked into _knowledge spindles_.

What's annoying about this relationship between my and many human minds to
many knowledge spindles is that they they can take advantage of a curiousity
instinct to always want to be digging deeper for more understanding to drive you
near an edge of the knowledge tree that is mostly unrelated to any other part,
which is in part why it ends up not being deemed worthwhile for the large effort
involved.
